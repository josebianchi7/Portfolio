                        servers and languages.  -->
                    <strong>Designated Homepage:</strong>
    
                    A designated homepage is a root directory for a webpage, which is often retrieved 
                    when a uniform resource locator (URL) request with a “/” following the “.com”, or 
                    equivalent, is requested. This “/” is mapped to the content or file at “/index.html”, 
                    also known as the designated homepage on the web server. The name of a designated 
                    homepage can reveal details about the server and language used. For example, if we see 
                    “default.html” instead, we can presume this homepage is on the Microsoft .NET server 
                    and C# is the programming language for .NET, which can be quickly looked up if not already known. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <!--Prompt 2:Explain what can be seen in the browser's Web Dev/Inspector Network tab output screen 
                        (use the concepts provided in the Exploration). What is different about the file's details 
                        when viewed from the web server versus the local computer?-->
                    <strong>Web Dev/ Inspector Network Tab:</strong>
    
                    In the Web Dev/ Inspector Network tab output screen, under Headers, the webpage file may list the 
                    request method "GET", a status code of 200 if the request was successful, and the language. This 
                    tab also shows the last modification, how the page was accepted, the hostname, and the machine/ 
                    browser details requesting the page. The file details differ if viewed from a web server versus 
                    the local computer, which begins with the names in the file list to view the Headers and the 
                    request URL. When viewing a file opened from a local computer path, the drive location instead 
                    of a scheme like “HTTPS//” will be shown in the URL. When viewing these details from a web server, 
                    we see items not found if viewing from a local drive, including remote address, age, cache 
                    expiration, server, accepted data, language, hostname, further details on the user agent, and more.

                        have a status 404.-->
                    <strong>Status Codes:</strong>
    
                    Of the files listed in the Web Dev/ Inspector Network tab output screen, a favicon.ico file has 
                    been requested successfully, thus returning a status code of 200. This result is due to the OSU 
                    web server providing that file/ resource so that their icon appears in the tab header on the browser. 
                    The main.css and main.js files have a status code of 404 because those resources are not found on 
                    the server for this page, due to those layers of code not yet being added to the page.
                </p>

                    <strong>Parts of This Page's URL:</strong>
    
                    For this URL on my OSU web server, the following parts include the scheme, “https://”, the subdomains, 
                    which are “web” and “engr”, the host domain at “oregonstate.edu”, which put together, this server 
                    hosts my HTML file resource. The resources/ path to my webpage is the remaining part of the URL,

                <p>
                    <!--Explain the concepts of frontend design.-->
                    <strong>Frontend Design:</strong>

                    Frontend design is centered on creating the most fitting experience for users. To accomplish this 
                    goal, developers focus on key concepts including the visual design of the page, the graphical 
                    user-interface (GUI), and the interactive experience. Starting with the visual design of the page, 
                    consistency is required across most components from color scheme, font and typography scheme, 
                    and photography, illustration, and icon scheme. The GUI components, for example, a scroll bar or 
                    other navigation systems, should try to be as intuitive as possible, to allow users to navigate the 
                    page or app easily. Lastly, the interactive experience should attract users and evolve periodically 
                    to maintain alignment with user expectations. Maintaining a positive interactive experience can be 
                    achieved through studying the usability/ inclusivity of a product or system.

                    <strong>The Five "E"s of Usability:</strong>
                    <dt>Effective</dt>
                    <dd>
                        A product, system, or service should be designed to assist users achieve their
                        goal(s) and attain accurate results. This can be achieved in a variety of ways but
                        should keep in mind possible device interfaces or platforms and focus on user 
                        expectations from said service or product.  
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Efficient</dt>
                    <dd>
                        To assist users, in meeting their objective(s) efficiently, the tasks should be 
                        performed with the minimum number of steps. In addition, the objectives should be 
                        concise and met as quickly as possible as the product, system, or service can support.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Easy to Navigate</dt>
                    <dd>
                        When users interact with a system or product, navigation within the product or 
                        system should be simple and intuitive, which is especially important for new 
                        users. Also, the steps to navigate should be memorable and provide methods to 
                        expedite locating a tool or resource for experienced users.                        
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Error-free</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Errors within a product or system should be removed immediately to avoid 
                        accessibility and availability issues. Common friction points or errors 
                        experienced by users can be corrected by observing users interact with the 
                        product or system.                        
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Enjoyable to Use or Engaging</dt>
                    <dd>
                        A user's experience with a service, system, or product should be enjoyable 
                        or engaging. The four previous "E"s of Usability are expected of users, 
                        but if users do not feel engaged or elated while using a product or service, 
                        they may be unlikely to be loyal customers. A great product or system needs to 
                        match the dynamic requirements of its audience and industry.

                    <strong>Page Layout Tags:</strong>
                    
                    The "header" page layout tag details the masthead or banner title for an 
                    application or site and lets users know they are operating within the same site. 
                    A "nav" tag takes users from the current page to other pages or affords users the 
                    ability to navigate within the current page. The "main" tag element represents the 
                    primary block, which contains the major content of a document. A “section” tag 
                    is to group content that is all related or similar in objective, but does not 
                    necessarily need to be highlighted individually. The “article” tag element is 
                    used to detail a specific topic within a second-level headline. The “footer” tag 
                    is placed after closing the main element and holds legal data, contact information, 
                    and any links to essential pages. At a minimum, the footer element should have the 
                    copyright symbol, the year of publication, and the name of the owning authority.
                </p>
                    <!--How do anchors link to external content, internal content, and from page-to-page?-->
                    <strong>Anchor Links:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        To link external content on a page via an anchor, an absolute path is required. 
                        An absolute path is implemented by inserting a full URL in an anchor element. 
                        The URL is placed within the quotations of the anchor element, and a 
                        description for that external site is placed within the anchor tags. 
                        
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Anchors link to internal content by using identification (ID) selectors that 
                        are placed within the page at desired jump points. The ID attribute will have 
                        within quotations a topic name, and that topic name is copied into the anchor 
                        quotations with a hashtag prefix.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Anchors link from page-to-page by a method similar to linking to external content, 
                        but with a relative path. A relative path directs to an additional page relative 
                        to the initial page, preferably using only the file or page name. The additional 
                        implementation of styled buttons can create a seamless transition that reinforces 
                        the sense the user is within the same directory of pages. In some instances, the 
                        URLs for the other pages resemble the initial page so greatly that it appears all 
                        the content is on a single page.

                <h3>Optimizing Images</h3>
                <p>
                    <!--Optimizing images: Name and explain the purpose of the 6 major image optimizing specifications.
                        Optimizing images: Name and explain the file formats appropriate for photos and for line art?
                     -->
                    <strong>6 Major Image Optimizing Specifications:</strong>

                    A descriptive file name is one of the six major image optimizing specifications. File names 
                    should provide enough data to expedite searching for an image via its name. However, the 
                    file name should also be condensed to a few words at most in the format of all lowercase 
                    lettering and hyphens between each word. These characteristics are especially important for 
                    search engine optimization (SEO) to assist search engine bots file an image with similar 
                    images with matching name components. Another major image optimizing specification is a 
                    petite file size. This aspect is essential in saving storage space, so the image may load 
                    as quickly as possible. Often images have so much data that they need to be compressed. 
                    Image compression can be completed via a lossy compression and/ or a lossless compression. 
                    A lossy compression, while very effective at reducing an image file size, will permanently 
                    remove redundant data and other less critical information. This may result in a reduction 
                    in resolution of the image, causing pixelation, if not done carefully. Lossless compression 
                    may not reduce a file size as much as lossy compression, but therefore retains greater image 
                    quality. This method is primarily used when data loss of the file must be kept to a minimum. 
                    Images with an exact dimension is also a major image optimizing specification. Cropping is 
                    used to fit images to their intended mediums, so that they can display as intended. Images 
                    exceeding the dimensions of their platform space will load slowly and will affect user 
                    experience. File format is an additional major image optimizing specification. Different 
                    file formats are more effective at displaying certain aspects of an image than others. 
                    For example, Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is efficient at providing very clean lines, 
                    so this file type is recommended for line art and animation. Joint Photographic Group 
                    (JPG) files are intended for online photographic images that users want to retain the 
                    great detail captured. Following using the correct file format, reduced resolution is a 
                    major image optimizing specification, that has become more essential as resolutions vary 
                    across media-viewing platforms. An industry standard has been ensuring images remain in a 
                    range of sizes to provide the best quality for the interface being used. Lastly, color mode 
                    is a major image optimizing specification. The most common color modes being utilized by 
                    frontend developers include Names, Hexidecimal and Hexa, Red-Green-Blue (RGB) and 
                    Red-Green-Blue Alpha (RGBa), and hue-saturation-luminosity/ lightness (HSL) and 
                    hue-saturation-luminosity/ lightness alpha (HSLa). These color modes can provide increasing 
                    options for a specific color to allow industries to maintain consistency with the guidelines
                    of a brand. RGBa and HSLa can provide the widest range of options for colors with transparency 
                    effects.

                <p>
                    <!--Optimizing images: Name and explain the file formats appropriate for photos and for line art?-->
                    <strong>Photo and Line Art File Formats:</strong>

                    The file formats appropriate for photographs are JPG and WebP. Photos have a large amount of 
                    information and detail, especially when taken on high-resolution cameras, and typically begin 
                    in JPG format. Photographs can then be compressed and remain in JPG format, or can be compressed 
                    further in WebP format, but this may noticeably reduce the quality of an image. For line art 
                    there are suitable file formats including SVG, Portable Network Graphics (PNG), and Graphics 
                    Interchange Format (GIF). SVG files utilize the most storage of the line art formats mentioned, 
                    but also can provide the best quality, due to it being mathematically derived and marked with 
                    Extensible Markup Language (XML) that is efficient at producing sharp lines. PNG files are 
                    typically the smallest in storage and ideal for biomorphic shapes, solid colors, and line art. 
                    This file type contains alpha channel, allowing for adjustment in transparency and removing 
                    parts of an image like the background when needed. PNG files commonly use the RGB color mode 
                    but can use the Index color mode for greater compression cases. Finally, GIF files have an 
                    8-bit transparency capability, which translates to a percentage setting for transparency 
                    adjustments. GIF files implement the Index color mode, have anti-alias edges that can smooth 
                    out, and are often animated for short photo/ video sequences.

                    <!--Favicons: How do browsers and devices use favicons?-->
                    <strong>Favicons:</strong>

                    By considering various file types and sizes, favicons are used by browsers and devices to 
                    identify themselves to users. This is accomplished by showing a symbol in the browser tab 
                    or specific entry point of an interface, which becomes an icon for that webpage or application. 
                    It is important to remember that favicons are also referred to as favorite icons or touch icons. 
                    The process to use a favicon begins with preparing an image to be properly outfitted for various 
                    formats that correspond to commonly used devices and browsers. After producing or generating 
                    multiple versions of an image, the versions are saved to an accessible location for the browser 
                    or application. Then when prompted, the specific browser or device retrieves the appropriate file 
                    and anchors the image to the bookmark, browser tab, and/ or search engine result. This process 
                    can enhance the user experience and reinforce the identity of the implementing company or product 
                    owner, which may lead to returning visitors or customers.

                    <strong>Reasons to Incorporate Stylesheets:</strong>

                    The major reasons to incorporate Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) include improving readability, 
                    usability, legibility, and reinforce brand recognition, through following brand guidelines. 
                    Stylesheets afford designers the ability to edit the appearance and behavior of multiple blocks 
                    of HTML elements to create a complete and thorough interface.

                    <!--Cascading Stylesheets: What are the 5 ways to incorporate styles? And why?-->
                    <strong>Ways to Incorporate Stylesheets:</strong>

                    There are five ways to incorporate stylesheets, beginning with linked global external CSS rules. 
                    This method is the most efficient and preferred method due to being able to apply styles to any 
                    page that links to the external global stylesheet. Any external stylesheet that is intended for 
                    use needs to be linked within the head block tag of the website file. Additional methods to 
                    incorporate styles include importing a global stylesheet and embedding styles directly into the 
                    HTML file with style tags. Importing a stylesheet provides similar benefits to linking a global 
                    stylesheet, but embedding is only useful for making direct and minor style changes to a specific 
                    block. An older method similar to embedding is providing inline style attributes and values, but 
                    is even less recommended than embedding. Lastly, stylesheets can be incorporated through JavaScript, 
                    by manipulating the Document Object Model, which connects web pages to scripts. This last method 
                    employs a tag search and updates specified object logic to apply style.

                    <!-- JavaScript: What are the main data types? -->
                    <strong>Main Data Types:</strong>

                    The main data types of a value in JavaScript include a number, a Boolean value of either true or false, 
                    a string of characters, a symbol which is unique and immutable, the special values of “null” and “undefined” 
                    which represent a nonexistent object and an undefined object respectively, and lastly an object, which can be 
                    viewed as a collection of properties.     
                </p>
                <p>
                    <!-- JavaScript: How are objects, arrays, and JSON used? -->
                    <strong>Objects, Arrays, and JSON Usages:</strong>

                    Objects can be used to reference, or be compared to, real world objects. By adding characteristics or properties 
                    to an object, we can create a better comparable entity to the physical representation or give shape to a new 
                    item or object that we want to apply further code onto. An array is used to create a sequenced object to potentially 
                    store data sets and have the ability to recall specific instances when needed through indexing. The array can also 
                    be used to apply code onto all or subsets of the elements in the array. Arrays are extremely useful in managing lists 
                    of key value pairs, lists, or related data. JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a popular file type for exchanging 
                    data between platforms and applications by converting objects and strings. A JSON file allows for objects to be mapped 
                    to a string in JSON format for storage convenience and/ or create JavaScript, or other programming language, objects 
                    from a JSON string to be recalled or manipulated in another environment.

                    <!-- JavaScript: How are conditionals and loops used? -->
                    <strong>Conditionals and Loops:</strong>

                    Conditional statements or operators are commonly used to apply a rule or code to an object if certain criteria are met. 
                    Conditionals are focused around determining if an expression is true or false, or close to one of those Boolean states. 
                    Then based on the comparison result, an action can be applied, or a result can be concluded. This is especially useful 
                    in ensuring data entries are verified, or a system is running appropriately. Conditional statements may involve loops 
                    which offer the ability to conduct a repeated action or apply some logic, until a predetermined end goal or break condition 
                    is met. Loops are ideal for applying logic to multiple objects or applying various conditions to a data set or object to 
                    ensure compliance or reach a desired output.     
                </p>

                    <!-- JavaScript: What is object-oriented programming?-->
                    <strong>Object-Oriented Programming:</strong>

                    Object-oriented programming is a style of coding in which objects with an identity, state, and behavior are created to allow 
                    for greater modularity and structure. Objects with these traits in JavaScript can be created through special functions such 
                    as classes like other programming languages, but do not have to be to contain many of the same properties offered by creating 
                    a class. Object-oriented programming enhances interoperability by creating clear and readable objects that may be contained 
                    in a hierarchy of related objects. This allows for logic or code to be applied in a waterfall type way that affects elements 
                    in a way that resembles how physical systems are viewed or pinpoints data through the properties of an object. For example, 
                    we define a car object and then as time progresses if we need to adjust an attribute of the object car, like seatbelt sensors 
                    should be added to all cars, then any objects that belong to the overarching object or class can easily have that property added.

                    <!-- JavaScript: What is functional programming?-->
                    <strong>Functional Programming:</strong>

                    Functional programming is utilizing the powerful feature of functions to process data. Most often, there is an input or input 
                    type that is known and an output that is desired. In this situation, we utilize “first class” values like functions to assign 
                    variables, create higher-order functions that can apply multiple simpler functions, and possibly return a function or value 
                    that may be utilized for future purposes. Functions are primarily constructed by creating a function name, determining how 
                    many inputs or arguments will be accepted by the function, then applying some logic onto the arguments, followed by, but not 
                    always, returning a result or output. Many programming languages have built-in functions for common practices. Using the “try” 
                    statement and “catch” clause, we can account for possible errors that may normally interrupt the function or cause an undesired 
                    or “undefined” output. Through functional programming and testing, we can create subprograms or objects that can relatively 
                    quickly process large amounts of data or conduct several iterations of code logic or arithmetic to obtain a requested result.
